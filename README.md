# RPCDefinitionToolkit

A toolkit for defining VistAs RPC interface including client and user types

Interplay of Data Analysis and MUMPS Analysis with as much automation as possible.

## Planned Rollout of RPC Interface Definition

--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
__D1__ | System RPC definitions - 8994, 101.24, 19 ... | ALL | 4 | March 1 | __Basic Definition of ALL 5500__ + nuance from VAM-1 for a subset of these RPCs

__D5__ | __MUMPS Code II__ (Package RPC effects) | FOIA | 9 | __August 9th__ | Enhance individual RPC definitions and develop new test scenarios based on their MUMPS implementations
