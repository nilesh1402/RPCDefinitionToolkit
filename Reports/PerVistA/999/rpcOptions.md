## RPC Options of 999 
    
Using _Active, Used RPC Options_ to subset 8994 and Build named RPCs. Expect a __15% reduction__ if we add a requirement that an RPC needs to belong to [1] an active option [2] belonging to a recently signed on user.
    
__Exception: with its inconsisent builds and 8994 and its lack of user sign ons and types, FOIA (999) does not follow a regular VistA pattern so many observations below don't apply to it.__

There are 108 RPC Broker options, 99 of which name __2,899__ RPCs. 2 of these options are marked 'deleted', leaving __2,808__ of such option-backed RPCs. A further 96 options are not assigned to an active, recently signed on user - of these, 16 had older, no longer active users. When those without signed-on users are removed, we're left with __1,051 (36.25%)__ RPCs backed by __1__ active options with users who recently signed on.
    
__Note__: options __ require keys and 15 options have Proxy Users - both need testing and analysis.
    
When compared to _Build RPCs_ and _8994 RPCs_:
    
  * Installed Builds name __2,157 (67.24%)__ RPCs not in used options while those options name __0__ RPCs not in these Builds ().
  * 8994 defines __2,625 (71.41%)__ RPCs not in user options while those options name __0__ RPCs not in 8994.
  
__Conclusion:__ _Used Options_ reduce the __3,679__ RPCs named by both Builds and 8994s to __1,051 (28.57%)__.

__TODO__:

  * Add Build data for options using option info in builds => see first introduction etc
  * PROXY users (see user class in user reduction): see the proxy users count. If close to all then very special option
  * Besides the CPRS option, pay attention to Active/SO options with a high proproportion of 0 users: MAG WINDOWS, CAPRI, MAGJ VISTARAD WINDOWS, KPA VRAM GUI, VPR APPLICATION PROXY
  * Focus on options with many 'Exclusive RPCs' like CAPRI, MAG DICOM VISA, YS BROKER1, R1SDCI and others which also have a highish number of users - unlike the OVERLAPPING options, these introduce whole new sets of RPCs
  * Implication of DELETING Excluded Options and their exclusive RPCs - reducing VistA size
