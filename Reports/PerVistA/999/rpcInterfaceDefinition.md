481 RPCs have no 'first distributed' date as their first builds lacked a date. Here is RPC distribution year by year, along with the small amount of deletion too. Note that only __69 (1.84%)__ RPCs are formally deleted though __947 (25.25%)__ should be.

__3674__ RPCs are implemented in __1203__ separate MUMPS routines, while __76__ identified RPCs lack an implementation. The highest number of RPCs per routine is __128__ (_SDEC_), the median is __2.0__, the lowest is __1__. __884 (73.48%)__ routines implement only active RPCs, __286__ only inactive RPCs (candidates for deletion?), while __33__ implement a mix of active and inactive RPCs.

The (outliers) that implement the most RPCs are ...
