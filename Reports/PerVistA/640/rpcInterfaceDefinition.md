## RPC Interface Definition for 640
    
There are __5,520__ RPCs, __4,487 (81.29%)__ of which are active. The first RPCs were distributed on _1996-04-14_, the last on _2018-05-22_. The last installation happened on _2018-06-19_.
    
RPCs are marked inactive in stages ...

54 RPCs have no 'first distributed' date as their first builds lacked a date. Here is RPC distribution year by year, along with the small amount of deletion too. Note that only __135 (2.45%)__ RPCs are formally deleted though __1,033 (18.71%)__ should be.

__5375__ RPCs are implemented in __1780__ separate MUMPS routines, while __145__ identified RPCs lack an implementation. The highest number of RPCs per routine is __129__ (_SDEC_), the median is __2.0__, the lowest is __1__. __1,434 (80.56%)__ routines implement only active RPCs, __281__ only inactive RPCs (candidates for deletion?), while __65__ implement a mix of active and inactive RPCs.

The (outliers) that implement the most RPCs are ...
