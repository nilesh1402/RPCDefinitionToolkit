19 RPCs have no 'first distributed' date as their first builds lacked a date. Here is RPC distribution year by year, along with the small amount of deletion too. Note that only __134 (2.49%)__ RPCs are formally deleted though __918 (17.08%)__ should be.

__5235__ RPCs are implemented in __1727__ separate MUMPS routines, while __141__ identified RPCs lack an implementation. The highest number of RPCs per routine is __128__ (_SDEC_), the median is __2.0__, the lowest is __1__. __1,417 (82.05%)__ routines implement only active RPCs, __243__ only inactive RPCs (candidates for deletion?), while __67__ implement a mix of active and inactive RPCs.

The (outliers) that implement the most RPCs are ...
