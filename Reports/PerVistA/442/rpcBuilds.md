__Notes:__
    
  * the list here (active and deleted) need to be compared to the 8994 list of the same system (preliminary check shows few 8994 for deleted or non build-defined RPCs and nearly all deleted RPCs don't appear in 8994)
  * > 1 type for an RPC (based on builds they appear in) seems to reflect mistakes or a change in a package/build designation name ('TEXT INTEGRATION UTILITIES' became 'TIU')
  * the "type" needs to be aligned with Package (9_4) prefixes to tie RPCs to VistA 'applications'.
