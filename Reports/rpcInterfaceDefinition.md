## VA VistA RPC Interface Definition 
    
There are __5,630__ RPCs, __4,551 (80.83%)__ of which are active. The first RPCs were distributed on _1996-04-14_, the last on _2018-05-22_. The last installation happened on _2018-06-19_.
    
RPCs are marked inactive in stages ...

\# | Stage | \# At/After
--- | --- | ---
1 | Total | 5,630
2 | 8994 Full Entry | 5,468
3 | Installed Build | 5,436
4 | Has currently used Active Option | 4,551



57 RPCs have no 'first distributed' date as their first builds lacked a date. Here is RPC distribution year by year, along with the small amount of deletion too. Note that only __150 (2.66%)__ RPCs are formally deleted though __1,079 (19.17%)__ should be.

__5468__ RPCs are implemented in __1803__ separate MUMPS routines, while __162__ identified RPCs lack an implementation. The highest number of RPCs per routine is __129__ (_SDEC_), the median is __2.0__, the lowest is __1__. __1,449 (80.37%)__ routines implement only active RPCs, __289__ only inactive RPCs (candidates for deletion?), while __65__ implement a mix of active and inactive RPCs.

The (outliers) that implement the most RPCs are ...

### Source Information for Integrated Definition
    
The integrated interface definition combines RPC definitions from multiple real VistA and FOIA. Overall __1,880 (33.39%)__ RPCs are not in FOIA.
